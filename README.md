**#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

The best way to write programs that are maintanable, readable and adaptable is to make it modular, use in line comments and making code reusable.
The advantages of working this way was being bale to reuse the code for other projects and it helps other developers understand it better when working in a team or alone. The CRUD module can be easily modified to fit any future projects, which i have already done on some personal projects.

**#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

I try to visualize it while i read through it. This at times would help me see mistakes and patters. I would also tackle a problem until i was stuck, then i would go for a walk or do other activities. The solution would come to me in these moments.
When developing the dashboard i recall not understanding the code at all. After some more reading about it and some time away from the code i was able to obtain a better understadning of it. This project was one of the hardest to understand, it challenged me to discover new perspectives.


**#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists are the doctors of the 21st century. We study how computers work on a micro and macro level to find better and more efficient solutions to everyday problems. Without computer scientists many of our daily activietes would not be possible.
My work helps companies like Grazioso Salvare be more efficient which saves money and helps them deliver their mission more rapidly.
